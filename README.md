# Telco-Churn-Project

A second assignment on Advanced Data Analytics course in University of Technology Sydney.
It is a two man project, with my colleague, Joshua Gavin Valerie.

This repository include a jupyter notebook file of the churn analytics including the explanations, and the dataset used.


To give the project a background, we acquire a dataset from a telecommunication company, which includes a churn variable, the churn variable.
Churn means that the customer stopped on using the company's service, which is a bad thing. The goal of this project is to classify what kind of customer that would more likely to churn.
